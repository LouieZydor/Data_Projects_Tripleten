# Tripleten Business Analytics Project

This is the second project I worked on for the Tripleten Data Analysis program. This project showed how to perform more complex calculations within spreadsheets and dive more deeply into cohort analysis'

### Business Analytics

The goal of this project was to clean the data and determine customer retention based on their individual cohorts and purchase activity

### The Data

The data was put into one main tab

- `raw_user_activity` All of the data for each user about their history ordering from the website
    - `'user_id'` The ID number to discern each individual user
    - `'event_type'` The event logged on the site from the user, such as a page view or a purchase
    - `'category_code'` The type of product followed by the make of the product
    - `'brand'` The product brand
    - `'price'` The price to purchase the product
    - `'event_date'` The datetime data of the event

### The Process

I first cleaned up the data in the dataset for errors, I then formed several pivot tables to get the needed information such as the first purchase date, how many views turned into purchases and customer retention.

### Results

The results are dictated in the Executive Summary tab of the spread sheet, showing the final results of the analysis.
